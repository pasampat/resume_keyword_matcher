## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Landing an interview often depends on using the right keywords.  
The **Resume Keyword Matcher** takes the guesswork out of resume tailoring:

- **Upload a job description** and up to **three resumes** (PDF or TXT).  
- Instantly see **keyword matches**, **missing terms**, and an **overall match percentage**.  
- Explore a **keyword frequency matrix** to compare resumes side by side.  

This tool makes it easy for job seekers to **optimize resumes for specific postings** and improve their chances of getting noticed.
